  description: "Runs an Intrinsic Latency test on the Redis Server using the Redis-CLI.\n\
    \nThis Job runs an intrinsic-latency test on the Redis Server to determine baseline\
    \ latency of Redis in your specific environment. \nRead more about diagnosing\
    \ Redis latency issues [here](https://redis.io/docs/reference/optimization/latency/).\n\
    \nThe steps in the Job are Remote Command steps, so they execute on the Node (or\
    \ Nodes) targeted by the Job.\n\nTo dictate which Node is targeted by the Job,\
    \ navigate to the Nodes tab in this Job definition and change the Node Filter\
    \ to align with your specific use-case.\n\n"
