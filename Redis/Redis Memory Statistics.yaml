    Retrieve memory statistics from Redis server using the redis-cli.

    This Job uses `redis-cli` commands such as `memory malloc-stats` and others to provide information useful for debugging issues related to redis instances.

    See the **Readme** for instructions on how to add remote-nodes and configure connectivity to them using methods such as SSH or Systems Manager (SSM).
    ---
    For adding remote-nodes, see the **Configure EC2 Inventory** tour.

    See the **Configuring Systems Manager** or **Configure SSH Connectivity** tours for guides on how to invoke the commands in this Job on remote Nodes.  These will also walk you through how to target specific nodes upon execution.

    And see the **Send Diagnostics to PagerDuty** tour for sending the output of the Job to PagerDuty incidents.
