    Returns entries from the slow log in chronological order.

    This Job executes the `SLOWLOG GET` command on the Redis server to retrieve queries that exceed the duration (in microseconds) set by the `slowlog-log-slower-than` configuration parameter.

    The **Number of Entries** Job Option dictates how many entries to retrieve from the `SLOWLOG`.  If retrieving _all_ entries is desired, simply remove the Job Option from the command.

    See the **Readme** for instructions on how to add remote-nodes and configure connectivity to them using methods such as SSH or Systems Manager (SSM).
    ---
    For adding remote-nodes, see the **Configure EC2 Inventory** tour.

    See the **Configuring Systems Manager** or **Configure SSH Connectivity** tours for guides on how to invoke the commands in this Job on remote Nodes.  These will also walk you through how to target specific nodes upon execution.

    And see the **Send Diagnostics to PagerDuty** tour for sending the output of the Job to PagerDuty incidents.
