    Performs simple test using the psql command

    This Job performs a simple test on the remote Linux host by executing the **`psql`** command.

    The full command used in the job is **`sudo -u postgresql psql`**.  As this may not address your specific setup, you may need to modify this command so that it works for your environment.

    Simply executing `psql` can validate whether the PostgreSQL service is running and accepting connections.

    See the [**Project Readme**](/project/automated-diagnostics/home) for recommended tours on how to add remote-nodes and configure connectivity to them using methods such as SSH or Systems Manager (SSM).
