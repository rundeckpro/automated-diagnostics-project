    Performs simple test using the psql command

    This Job performs a simple test on the remote Linux host by executing the `psql` command.

    The full command used in the job is `sudo -u postgresql psql`.  As this may not address your specific setup, you may need to modify this command so that it works for your environment.

    Simply executing `psql` can validate whether the PostgreSQL service is running and accepting connections.

    See the **Readme** for instructions on how to add remote-nodes and configure connectivity to them using methods such as SSH or Systems Manager (SSM).

    For adding remote-nodes, see the **Configure EC2 Inventory** tour.

    See the **Configuring Systems Manager** or **Configure SSH Connectivity** tours for guides on how to invoke the commands in this Job on remote Nodes.  These will also walk you through how to target specific nodes upon execution.

    And see the **Send Diagnostics to PagerDuty** tour for sending the output of the Job to PagerDuty incidents.
