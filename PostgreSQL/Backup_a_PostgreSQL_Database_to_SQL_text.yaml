  description: "Adhoc PostgreSQL DB Backup:\n\nThis job will:\n- Backup a PostgreSQL\
    \ database using the `pg_dump` command.  \n- The output will be saved to plain\
    \ text SQL file.\n- The SQL file will be read out using `cat` to the output log.\
    \  \n- The SQL file will then be optionally deleted as a cleanup step based on\
    \ the input choice.\n\nIt is recommended to run the job on a single Enterprise\
    \ Runner node with `pg_dump` installed.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- The `pg_dump`\
    \ command must be installed on the same machine as the Enterprise Runner and be\
    \ available in the default path.\n- The password can be provided directly as part\
    \ of the input options.  For production use we recommend using a Key Storage entry.\n\
    \nThis job is for demonstration purposes only.\n"
