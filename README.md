# Automated Diagnostics - Runbook Automation Solution
The Automated Diagnostics Solution is a collection of prebuilt Automation Jobs that retrieve data for investigation, debugging and diagnosing of incidents. 
These are built to work with PagerDuty's [Runbook Automation](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/automation/runbook/) or the self-hosted [Process Automation](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/automation/process-software/) - FKA Rundeck Enterprise.
