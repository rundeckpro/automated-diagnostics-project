  description: |
    List the largest files by file size in the current directory and its subdirectories.

    ## Assumptions
    - Job assumes the node is Linux endpoint with `du`, `sort`, and `head` installed.
    - Default start directory is the Runner Execution folder, or home folder of authenticated user on remote nodes.

    ## Notes
    - No nodes are selected by default.  Change Target Nodes and select the endpoint to run against.
    - The job can take a long time to run if the directory has a lot of files in it.
