  description: "Retrieve diagnostic CPU and Memory information from Linux systems.\n\
    \nThis Job executes commands on remote Linux instances and retrieves diagnostic\
    \ OS and process-level information.\n\nInstances must be added as Nodes in order\
    \ for this Job to work correctly. \n\nInstructions for adding various VM's - such\
    \ as EC2's, Azure VM's and Google Compute Instances - can be found in [this section\
    \ of documentation](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/projects/resource-model-sources/).\n\
    \nClick on the **ReadMe** for additional details on connecting to Nodes using\
    \ Runbook Automation.\n---\nIf connecting to Nodes using SSH, follow [this documentation](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/learning/howto/ssh-on-linux-nodes.html#using-ssh-on-linux-unix-nodes)\
    \ \nto set up your Nodes and SSH Credentials and - if using Runbook Automation\
    \ SaaS - also use [this documentation](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/administration/runner/#architecture)\
    \ to set up a Runner for this Project.\n\nIf connecting to Nodes using Amazon's\
    \ Systems Manager (formerly known as SSM), following [this documentation](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/projects/node-execution/aws-ssm.html#description)\
    \ to configure the integration."
