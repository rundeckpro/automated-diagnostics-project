    Retrieve the status of a specific service running a remote Linux host.

    This Job uses `systemctl` to retrieve the status of an individual service running on a remote linux node.

    See the **Readme** for instructions on how to add remote-nodes and configure connectivity to them using methods such as SSH or Systems Manager (SSM).
    ---
    For adding remote-nodes, see the **Configure EC2 Inventory** tour.

    See the **Configuring Systems Manager** or **Configure SSH Connectivity** tours for guides on how to invoke the commands in this Job on remote Nodes.  These will also walk you through how to target specific nodes upon execution.

    And see the **Send Diagnostics to PagerDuty** tour for sending the output of the Job to PagerDuty incidents.
