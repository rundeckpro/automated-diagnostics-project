    Query CloudWatch logs to identify the top 10 source-IP addresses with the highest rejected-requests.

    The Job uses the CloudWatch Logs plugin, and therefore AWS Credentials must be applied to the Job Step or at the Project level (`project.aws.access_key` and `project.aws.secret_key_path`) or at the Framework level (`aws.access_key` and `aws.secret_key_path`).

    If the self-hosted Process Automation server is running in AWS, you can alternatively assign an IAM Role to the EC2 or container.
